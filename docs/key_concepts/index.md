#Key concepts - index

In this section we will explore the main concepts to understand how agent services
work internally. This requires to introduce some preliminary topics, namely, [AEAs](../aea.md),
[FSMs](../fsm.md) and the [ABCI](../abci.md). If you are already familiar with those topics,
you can skip and go directly to the [introduction to FSM Apps](../fsm_app_introduction.md), 
where we present in detail all the internal components that make up an {{fsm_app}}, 
which is the core component running the business logic in an agent service.

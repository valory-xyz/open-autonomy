{{open_autonomy}} is a framework for the creation of [agent services](./get_started/what_is_an_agent_service.md): off-chain
autonomous services which run as a multi-agent-system (MAS) and offer **enhanced functionalities
on-chain**. Agent services expand the range of operations that traditional
smart contracts offer, making it possible to execute arbitrarily complex operations
(such as machine-learning algorithms). Most importantly, agent services are
**decentralized**, **trust-minimized**, **transparent**, and **robust**.

The framework provides:

* A collection of **command line tools** to build, deploy, publish and test agent services.
* A collection of base **packages** to provide agents the functionalities to become part of an agent service.

!!! abstract "Read the Whitepaper"

    The {{ autonolas_whitepaper }}, presents a comprehensive discussion on the architecture of the Autonolas stack. The Open Autonomy framework connects with the **Technical Architecture** section therein as a facilitator to build autonomous services.

## Building with Open Autonomy

The framework is designed to speed up the development life cycle of autonomous services, helping you to bring your services from an idea to production as quick as possible. Overall, this is the general path that you should have in mind when working with {{open_autonomy}}:

#The Open Autonomy framework




{{open_autonomy}} is a framework for the creation of **agent services**: off-chain
autonomous services which run as a multi-agent-system (MAS) and offer **enhanced functionalities
on-chain**. Agent services expand the range of operations that traditional
smart contracts provide, making it possible to execute arbitrarily complex operations
(such as machine-learning algorithms). Most importantly, agent services are
**decentralized**, **trust-minimized**, **transparent**, and **robust**.

# Application Control Flow

!!! info
    This section is under review and will be updated soon.

Within a deployment, each individual agent instance in the AI agent manages:
- a Tendermint Node
- an ABCI application

Each of the agent instances - containing the ABCI app - and the Tendermint node, are implemented as a Docker image which are deployed in a 1-2-1 relationship.

The Tendermint process is managed by a separate process, via a Flask server. The image containing the Flask server and Tendermint node are built on top of the ```valory/tendermint``` image.

## Tendermint Image control flow.

# AEA Network interruption Flow
When we have an issue with the AEA losing connection to the Tendermint process, caused by failure of the AEA, the sudden closure of the TCP connection will trigger a restart of the Tendermint process.

This failure of connection could be caused by a re-scheduling of the pod to another host within the cluster, or by another unexpected restart of the AEA container.

This can be simulated by kill a running aea-process while running a docker-compose deployment.

This will interrupt the TCP connection between the AEA and the Tendermint process, managed by the Flask process. The typical behaviour for Tendermint upon such an event is to stop the module responsible for handling *all* http traffic. We watch for this event, and then restart the Tendermint process upon detecting it.


```bash
# kill the aea
docker-compose kill abci0 && docker-compose up -d abci0
```

```bash
tail -f deployments/persistent_data/logs/node_0.txt

Tendermint process stopped
Tendermint process started
Restarted the HTTP RPC server, as a connection was dropped with message:
		 E[2022-05-11|13:15:11.368] Stopping abci.socketClient for error: read message: EOF module=abci-client connection=consensus
```

# Tendermint Network interruption Flow
When we have an issue with the Tendermint process connecting to the AEA, the sudden closure of the TCP connection will trigger a restart of the tendermint process.

The effect of this on the AEA, can be demonstrated as so;
```bash
# kill the node
docker-compose kill node0 && docker-compose up -d node0
```
The logs for the associated AEA show;

```bash

```
Notice how the AEA continues as soon as it is able to re-establish a connection.

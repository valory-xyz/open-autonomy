## Deploy

```
$ autonomy deploy
Usage: autonomy deploy [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
  Deploy an AEA project.
Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
Commands:
  build  Build the agent and its components.
```

### Build tools

1. Service deployment

    ```bash
    Usage: autonomy deploy build [OPTIONS] [KEYS_FILE]

      Build deployment setup for n agents.

    Options:
      --o PATH                        Path to output dir.
      --n INTEGER                     Number of agents.
      --docker                        Use docker as a backend.
      --kubernetes                    Use kubernetes as a backend.
      --dev                           Create development environment.
      --force                         Remove existing build and overwrite with new
                                      one.
      --log-level [INFO|DEBUG|WARNING|ERROR|CRITICAL]
                                      Logging level for runtime.
      --packages-dir PATH             Path to packages dir (Use with dev mode)
      --open-aea-dir PATH             Path to open-aea repo (Use with dev mode)
      --open-autonomy-dir PATH        Path to open-autonomy repo (Use with dev
                                      mode)
      --aev                           Apply environment variable when loading
                                      service config.
      --use-hardhat                   Include a hardhat node in the deployment
                                      setup.
      --use-acn                       Include an ACN node in the deployment setup.
      --image-version TEXT            Define runtime image version.
      --remote                        To use a remote registry.
      --local                         To use a local registry.
      -p                              Ask for password interactively
      --password PASSWORD             Set password for key encryption/decryption
      --help                          Show this message and exit.
    ```

    To execute this command you need to be located within a service folder. That is, a folder containing the service definition file (`service.yaml`) and a file containing keys with funds for the chain you want to use. The deployment will be created in the subfolder `./abci_build`.

2. Agent service images

    ```bash
    Usage: autonomy build-image [OPTIONS] [PUBLIC_ID_OR_HASH]

      Build runtime images for autonomous agents.

    Options:
      --service-dir PATH  Path to service dir.
      --version TEXT      Specify tag version for the image.
      --dev               Build development image.
      --pull              Pull latest dependencies.
      --help              Show this message and exit.
    ```

    ```bash
    # To build an image, navigate to the service dir and run
    $ autonomy build-image
    ```

    To execute this command you need to be located within a service directory. That is, a directory containing the service definition file (`service.yaml`) and a file containing keys with funds for the chain you want to use. Images generated by this command will follow `valory/oar-<PUBLIC_ID>` format for labels.

    If you just want to build image for a specific agent without fetching a service run

    ```bash
    $ autonomy build-image PUBLIC_ID
    ```

3. Run deployments

    ```bash
    Usage: autonomy deploy run [OPTIONS]

      Run deployment.

    Options:
      --build-dir PATH
      --no-recreate     If containers already exist, dont recreate them.
      --remove-orphans  Remove containers for services not defined in the Compose
                        file.
      --help            Show this message and exit.
    ```

    This command is a wrapper around `docker-compose up` to run the service deployment.  To execute this command you need to be located within the deployment environment subfolder (`./abci_build`).

4. One click deployments

    If you have a service registered on-chain you can deploy the services directly using token IDs generated after the minting the service component. See the [register a service on-chain](./guides/register_packages_on_chain.md#register-a-service) guide for more information.

    ```bash
    Usage: autonomy deploy from-token [OPTIONS] TOKEN_ID KEYS_FILE

      Run service deployment.

    Options:
      --rpc TEXT      Custom RPC URL
      --sca TEXT      Service contract address for custom RPC URL.
      --n INTEGER     Number of agents to include in the build.
      --skip-images   Skip building images.
      --use-goerli    Use goerli chain to resolve the token id.
      --use-ethereum  Use ethereum chain to resolve the token id.
      --use-staging   Use staging chain to resolve the token id.
      --remote        To use a remote registry.
      --local         To use a local registry.
      --help          Show this message and exit.
    ```

    To run a deployment for the on-chain service you need the token id for the minted service and funded keys. Save the keys in the `keys.json` and run

    ```bash
    $ autonomy deploy from-token <TOKEN_ID> keys.json
    ```

    Currently we support Autonolas staging chain, GÃ¶rli testnet and Ethereum mainnet for resolving on-chain token ids, but if you have a contract deployed on some other chain you can provide the RPC URL to the chain and contract address using `--rpc` and `--sca`.


You can see an example on how to use the commands in this section to build and run a local deployment (Hello world agent service) in the [quick start guide](./guides/quick_start.md).

## Replay

Replay tools can be used to re-run the agents execution using data dumps from previous runs.

**Note: Replay only works for deployments which were ran in dev mode**

```bash
Usage: autonomy replay [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
  Replay tools.
Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
Commands:
  agent       Agent runner.
  tendermint  Tendermint runner.
```

### agent

```bash
Usage: autonomy replay agent [OPTIONS] AGENT
  Agent runner.
Options:
  --build PATH     Path to build dir.
  --registry PATH  Path to registry folder.
  --help           Show this message and exit.
```

### tendermint

```bash
Usage: autonomy replay tendermint [OPTIONS]
  Tendermint runner.
Options:
  --build PATH  Path to build directory.
  --help        Show this message and exit.
```


## Replay agents runs from Tendermint dumps

1. Copy and paste the following Makefile into your local environment:

```bash
.PHONY: run-hardhat
run-hardhat:
  docker run -p 8545:8545 -it valory/open-autonomy-hardhat:0.1.0

# if you get following error
# PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/open-aea/build/bdist.linux-x86_64/wheel'
# or similar to PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: /**/build
# remove build directory from the folder that you got error for
# for example here it should be /path/to/open-aea/repo/build
.PHONY: run-oracle-dev
run-oracle-dev:
  if [ "${OPEN_AEA_REPO_DIR}" = "" ];\
  then\
    echo "Please ensure you have set the environment variable 'OPEN_AEA_REPO_DIR'"
    exit 1
  fi
  if [ "$(shell ls ${OPEN_AEA_REPO_DIR}/build)" != "" ];\
  then \
    echo "Please remove ${OPEN_AEA_REPO_DIR}/build manually."
    exit 1
  fi

  autonomy build-image valory/oracle_hardhat --dev && \
    autonomy deploy build valory/oracle_hardhat deployments/keys/hardhat_keys.json --force --dev && \
    make run-deploy

.PHONY: run-deploy
run-deploy:
  if [ "${PLATFORM_STR}" = "Linux" ];\
  then\
    mkdir -p abci_build/persistent_data/logs
    mkdir -p abci_build/persistent_data/venvs
    sudo chown -R 1000:1000 -R abci_build/persistent_data/logs
    sudo chown -R 1000:1000 -R abci_build/persistent_data/venvs
  fi
  if [ "${DEPLOYMENT_TYPE}" = "docker-compose" ];\
  then\
    cd abci_build/ &&  \
    docker-compose up --force-recreate -t 600 --remove-orphans
    exit 0
  fi
  if [ "${DEPLOYMENT_TYPE}" = "kubernetes" ];\
  then\
    kubectl create ns ${VERSION}|| (echo "failed to deploy to namespace already existing!" && exit 0)
    kubectl create secret generic regcred \
          --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=/home/$(shell whoami)/.docker/config.json \
          --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson -n ${VERSION} || (echo "failed to create secret" && exit 1)
    cd abci_build/ && \
      kubectl apply -f build.yaml -n ${VERSION} && \
      kubectl apply -f agent_keys/ -n ${VERSION} && \
      exit 0
  fi
  echo "Please ensure you have set the environment variable 'DEPLOYMENT_TYPE'"
  exit 1
```
Then define the relevant environment variables.


2. Run your preferred app in dev mode, for example run oracle in dev using `make run-oracle-dev` and in a separate terminal run `make run-hardhat`.

3. Wait until at least one reset (`reset_and_pause` round) has occurred, because the Tendermint server will only dump Tendermint data on resets. Once you have a data dump stop the app.

4. Run `autonomy replay tendermint` . This will spawn a tendermint network with the available dumps.

5. Now  you can run replays for particular agents using `autonomy replay agent AGENT_ID`. `AGENT_ID` is a number between `0` and the number of available agents `-1`. E.g. `autonomy replay agent 0` will run the replay for the first agent.

```

Aggregating results from deployments.

To use this tool you'll need benchmark data generated from agent runtime. To generate benchmark data run

```
$ autonomy deploy build PATH_RO_KEYS --dev
```

By default this will create a 4 agent runtime where you can wait until all 4 agents are at the end of the first period (you can wait for more periods if you want) and then you can stop the runtime. The data will be stored in `abci_build/persistent_data/benchmarks` folder.

Run deployment using

```bash
$ cd abci_build/
$ docker-compose up
```

You can use this tool to aggregate this data.

```bash
autonomy analyse benchmarks abci_build/persistent_data/benchmarks
```

By default tool will generate output for all periods but you can specify which period to generate output for, same goes for block types as well.


## Fetch

```bash
Usage: autonomy fetch [OPTIONS] PUBLIC_ID_OR_HASH

  Fetch an agent from the registry.

Options:
  --remote      To use a remote registry.
  --local       To use a local registry.
  --alias TEXT  Provide a local alias for the agent.
  --agent       Provide a local alias for the agent.
  --service     Provide a local alias for the agent.
  --help        Show this message and exit.
```

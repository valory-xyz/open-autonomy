# Cloud Deployment

We have provided a number of ways to run agent services build with the {{open_autonomy}} framework across multiple different cloud providers.

The deployment has been implemented using a minimal distribution of Kubernetes to run as close to the bare metal as allowable.

This approach leads to a number of key benefits for node operators and infrastructure providers:

1. No reliance upon an individual provider. We currently provide documentation coverage for both Digital Ocean and for Amazon Web Services (AWS).
2. Lower costs compared to using a managed alternative.
3. Easily portable across different cloud providers.

We have 3 deployment options available for external operators.

- Docker Compose: This approach is advised for beginners/less experienced users.
- Kubernetes Cluster: We provide full deployments for Kubernetes:
    - Single Node - This deployment approach is recommended for individual applications.
    - Multi Node - This deployment approach is recommended for more advanced users looking to running multiple agent nodes or applications.

Infrastructure deployment is handled by [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to ensure replicability across multiple providers whilst allowing external operators to configure the deployments to match their specific deployment requirements.


## Kubernetes Cluster
### Pre-requisites

We require a domain for our cluster. This allow us to route traffic to our cluster controller node. This is a pre-requisite of both Kubernetes based deployments, however the docker-compose deployment is able to skip this step.

The domain can be acquired from a domain registrar such as [goDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com). Most cloud providers also offer this as a service such as AWS. The key requirement is to be able to update the domain registrars nameserver (NS) records easily.

###Install dependencies.

- [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/): Deployment Orchestration
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation): Local Cluster deployment and management.
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/): Kubernetes CLI tool.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): Container backend.
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html): Infrastructure management as code.



### Step-by-step Deployment Instructions

1. Acquire the external operator code.
```bash
svn checkout https://github.com/valory-xyz/open-autonomy/trunk/infrastructure
cd infrastructure
```

### Setup on Digital Ocean Cloud Provider
1. We need to first create an authentication file to be used by terraform to create cloud resources. This can be done from the [API Settings](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens). Save this file within the root directory as ```infrastructure/do_creds```
2. Now we have our authentication token, we need to setup the domain we registered earlier. This is again done from the [Network & Domains](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/networking/domains) section of Digital Ocean.
3. Create a new domain by entering your domain

4. Once the domain has been setup on Digital Ocean, you will be provided with a list of Nameservers as so;
![Image title](images/do_name_servers.png){ align=center }
You MUST configure your domain provider to point at these name servers like so;
![Image title](images/name_server_setup.png){ align=center }

5. Once you have completed these steps, you are now ready to deploy the cluster to the infrastructure.
```bash
cd infrastructure/digital_ocean
terraform init # download required terraform packages
terraform apply # deploy resources and approve when prompted.
```
This will generate a kubeconfig which can be used to interact with the newly deployed resources. NOTE. This provides root access to the cluster so ensure that it is protected.

### Setup on AWS
1. Login to AWS console.
2. Create a Hosted Zone.
3. Use the Hosted Zones generated Nameservers to update the registrar with the correct Nameservers
4. Create a service account
5. Give the Service account the Dev-Ops Security group role
6. create an access key and token and then save this file to;
```infrastructure/aws_token```
7. Once these steps are completed, the infrastructure can be deployed with;
```bash
cd infrastructure/aws
terraform init # download required terraform packages
terraform apply # deploy resources and approve when prompted.
```

### Post Cluster Deployment Setup

Once the cluster has been deployed, we need to go ahead and actually deploy our application the cluster. We have included a number of convenience commands to speed this process up.

Depending upon the Cloud Provider selected above, the user must now point their Kubectl at the newly deployed cluster as so;

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/infrastructure/digital_ocean/kubefiles/kubeconfig
```

1. deploy cluster permissions and a dashboard to view status
```bash
make cluster-setup
```
2. Create the deployment yamls
```bash
make cluster-create-deployments
```
3. deploy the yamls
```bash
make cluster-deploy
```
4. check the progress via the dashboard
```bash
make cluster-dashboard-start
```

This will print a URL along with a password to allow access to the kubernetes dashboard where you will be able to see the status of the running containers along with their logs.

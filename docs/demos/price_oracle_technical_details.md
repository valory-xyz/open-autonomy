#Price Oracle - Technical Details

Agents communicate directly to their local Tendermint node, whereas the `AbciApp`
is used to handle requests they receive (e.g., in response to their behaviour).

In addition to other general-use components (e.g., signing, HTTP client), the components of the  AEAs related to the implementation of the agent service are:

- Protocol `valory/abci:0.1.0`: it allows representing
    ABCI request and response messages.
- Connection `valory/abci:0.1.0`: it accepts ABCI requests
    from a consensus engine module, e.g. the Tendermint node;
- Skill `valory/abstract_abci:0.1.0`: it provides a
    scaffold handler for ABCI requests. It is an abstract skill.
- Skill `valory/abstract_round_abci:0.1.0`: it
    implements an ABCI handler and provides
    useful code abstractions for creating round-based
    replicated state machines, based on the ABCI protocol
    (e.g. `Period`, `AbstractRound`). It is an abstract skill.

Moreover, it has the following specific components to implement the particular case of the price oracle agent service:

- `valory/price_estimation_abci`: it implements the round-based
    ABCI application for price estimation of a cryptocurrency,
    with a finalization step over an Ethereum chain.


## The constituent {{fsm_app}}s

The ABCI-based replicated FSM (`AbciApp`) used for price estimation consists
of several smaller modules, each of which is an `AbciApp` of its own. Each of
them is a `Skill`, which implies that they operate independently of each other,
however they can be combined to create a larger `AbciApp`, provided that the
developer specifies the required transition mapping to connect these FSMs.
This modularity allows a developer to use a subset of these skills in different
contexts, potentially in combination with skills they themselves define, to
create another composite `AbciApp` that performs according to their particular
needs. Specifically, the `PriceEstimationAbciApp` is created by combining the
following parts:

- `AgentRegistrationAbciApp`
- `SafeDeploymentAbciApp`
- `OracleDeploymentAbciApp`
- `PriceAggregationAbciApp`
- `TransactionSubmissionAbciApp`
- `ResetPauseABCIApp`

### The `AgentRegistrationAbciApp`

This `AbciApp` implements the registration of agents to partake in the behaviour
scheduled in subsequent rounds.

0. `RegistrationStartupRound` <br/>

1. `RegistrationRound` <br/>
   In this round registrations from AEAs to join the period are accepted, up to
   a configured maximum number of participants (in the demo, this limit is 4);
   once this threshold is hit ("registration threshold"), the round is finished.

2. `FinishedRegistrationRound` <br/>
   A round that signals agent registration was successful, but service contracts has not been already deployed.

3. `FinishedRegistrationFFWRound` <br/>
   A round that signals agent registration was successful, and the service contracts are already deployed.


### The `SafeDeploymentAbciApp`

This `AbciApp` implements the deployments of a Gnosis safe contract, which is
a multisig smart contract wallet that requires a minimum number of people to
approve a transaction before it can occur. This assures that no single agent
can compromise the funds contained in it.

0. `RandomnessSafeRound` <br/>
   Some randomness is retrieved to be used in a keeper agent selection. In
   particular, agents individually request the latest random number from
   [DRAND](https://drand.love), establish consensus on it and then use
   it as a seed for computations requiring randomness (e.g. keeper selection).

1. `SelectKeeperSafeRound` <br/>
   The agents agree on a new keeper that will be in charge of sending deploying
   the multisig wallet and settling transactions.

2. `DeploySafeRound` <br/>
   A designated sender among the participants of the current period deploys a
   <a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/">Gnosis Safe contract</a> with all the
   participants as owners and with `ceil((2n + 1) / 3)` as threshold. If the
   safe deployment has not been completed after some time, a new keeper will be
   selected and the safe deployment will be re-run.

3. `ValidateSafeRound` <br/>
   All agents validate the previous deployment to ensure that the correct
   contract with the correct settings has been deployed. If the safe deployment
   could not be verified, the process will start again from the registration
   round.

4. `FinishedSafeRound` <br/>
   A round that signals the safe contract was deployed successfully.


### The `OracleDeploymentAbciApp`

This `AbciApp` implements the deployments of an Oracle contract, a Gnosis safe
multisig smart contract wallet that was forked from [Chainlink](https://chain.link/)
and subsequently stripped from unnecessary data structures and behaviours.

0. `RandomnessOracleRound` <br/>
   Similar as to the `RandomnessSafeRound`, randomness is retrieved here, this
   time for the selection of an agent to become the oracle keeper.

1. `SelectKeeperOracleRound` <br/>
   The agents select a new keeper that will be in charge of sending deploying
   the multisig wallet and settling transactions.

2. `DeployOracleRound` <br/>
   The designated keeper deploys a Gnosis safe contract. If a timeout occurs
   before oracle deployment was completed, a new keeper will be selected and
   the oracle deployment will be re-run.

3. `ValidateOracleRound` <br/>
   all agents verify that the Oracle contract has been  deployed using the
   expected settings. If that's not the case, agents will restart the period.

4. `FinishedOracleRound`
   A round that signals the oracle contract was deployed successfully.


### The `PriceAggregationAbciApp`

This `AbciApp` implements off-chain aggregation of observations by the agents.
Once the majority of agents has submitted their observation these are shared
with all agents as they move to the price estimation round. In this next round
each of the agents performs off-chain a computation on the data set, which could
be a simple summary statistic or an estimate derived from a complex model -
either way this is something that cannot be done on-chain. Once consensus is
reached on this estimate, the aggregate value is submitted and recorded
on-chain in the next block that is mined.

0. `CollectObservationRound` <br/>
   Observational data is collected by the AEAs on the target quantity to
   estimate. Once the agents reach consensus over this data, that is to say at
   least 2/3rd of them agree on the set of single observations collected by
   agents (not on individual observations), the shared state gets updated and
   the agents enter the next round.

1. `EstimateConsensusRound` <br/>
   Based on the collected data the actual price of the asset is estimated, which
   could be a simple summary statistic such as the median or the geometric mean.
   Once the same estimate receives a number of votes greater or equal than
   2/3 of the total voting power, consensus is reached and the period moves
   forward.

2. `TxHashRound` <br/>
   A designated sender composes the transaction and puts it on the temporary
   Tendermint-based chain. Signing of the transaction for the multisig smart
   contract requires consensus among the agents on the transaction hash to use.

3. `FinishedPriceAggregationRound` <br/>
   A round that signals price aggregation was completed successfully.


### The `TransactionSubmissionAbciApp`

0. `RandomnessTransactionSubmissionRound` <br/>
   Randomness is retrieved for keeper selection.

1. `SelectKeeperTransactionSubmissionRoundA` <br/>
   The agents select a keeper that will be in charge of sending the transaction.

2. `CollectSignatureRound` <br/>
   Agents sign the transaction to be submitted.

3. `FinalizationRound` <br/>
   The keeper sends off the transaction to be incorporated in the next block.
   A transaction hash is returned. This round takes care of submitting
   with the right amount of gas, i.e., if resubmitting, then the "tip" for the miners
   is also increased by 10%.

4. `ValidateTransactionRound` <br/>
   Agents validate whether the transaction has been incorporated in the
   blockchain.

5. `CheckTransactionHistoryRound` <br/>
   This round is triggered if the `ValidateTransactionRound` returns with
   a `NEGATIVE` `Event`, which means that the transaction has not been validated.
   During the round, the agents check the transaction history up to this point again
   in order to specify the cause of the problem, e.g., a transaction of a keeper
   was settled before another keeper managed to do so, a payload is invalid, etc.

6. `SelectKeeperTransactionSubmissionRoundB` <br/>
   The agents select a keeper that will be in charge of sending the transaction,
   in case that the first keeper has failed.

7. `ResetRound` <br/>
   In case that a failure such as round timeout or no majority reached, the period
   is reset.

8. `ResetAndPauseRound` <br/>
   A round that updates the `SynchronizedData` to allocate a new period before going to the
   `FinishedTransactionSubmissionRound`.

9. `FinishedTransactionSubmissionRound` <br/>
   A round that signals transaction submission was completed successfully.

10. `FailedRound` <br/>
    A round that signals transaction submission has failed. Occurs if the
    `CheckTransactionHistoryRound` does not manage to find a validated transaction
    in the history, or if a Reset round fails.


### Implementation of the `PriceEstimationAbciApp`

In the final implementation the `PriceEstimationAbciApp` is then assembled from
its constituent parts. However, in order to combine the various FSMs previously
discussed, a transition mapping between states of these FSMs also needs to be
provided. In order to combine the different FSMs we need to connect them by
providing the necessary transition mapping. As per the code implemented in the
demo, the implementation looks as follows:

```python
abci_app_transition_mapping: AbciAppTransitionMapping = {
    FinishedRegistrationRound: RandomnessSafeRound,
    FinishedSafeRound: RandomnessOracleRound,
    FinishedOracleRound: CollectObservationRound,
    FinishedRegistrationFFWRound: CollectObservationRound,
    FinishedPriceAggregationRound: RandomnessTransactionSubmissionRound,
    FailedRound: ResetAndPauseRound,
    FinishedTransactionSubmissionRound: ResetAndPauseRound,
    FinishedResetAndPauseRound: CollectObservationRound,
    FinishedResetAndPauseErrorRound: RegistrationRound,
}

OracleAbciApp = chain(
    (
        AgentRegistrationAbciApp,
        SafeDeploymentAbciApp,
        OracleDeploymentAbciApp,
        PriceAggregationAbciApp,
        TransactionSubmissionAbciApp,
        ResetPauseABCIApp,
    ),
    abci_app_transition_mapping,
)
```

Find below a graphical representation of this composition showing how the constituent FSMs interconnect to achieve the
functionality of the agent service in the demo.

</figure>


The AbstractRoundBehaviour schedules the state behaviour associated with the current round, ensuring that a transition to the new state cannot occur without first invoking the associated state Behaviour. Since it is composed of the Behaviours belonging to the constituent FSMs, we can reference them as depicted below.


```python
class OracleAbciAppConsensusBehaviour(AbstractRoundBehaviour):
    """This behaviour manages the consensus stages for the price estimation."""

    initial_behaviour_cls = RegistrationStartupBehaviour
    abci_app_cls = OracleAbciApp  # type: ignore
    behaviours: Set[Type[BaseBehaviour]] = {
        *OracleDeploymentRoundBehaviour.behaviours,
        *AgentRegistrationRoundBehaviour.behaviours,
        *SafeDeploymentRoundBehaviour.behaviours,
        *TransactionSettlementRoundBehaviour.behaviours,
        *ResetPauseABCIConsensusBehaviour.behaviours,
        *ObserverRoundBehaviour.behaviours,
    }
```

Have a look at the [FSM diagram](./price_oracle_fsms.md) of the application in order
to see what the encoded state transitions in the final composite FSM look like.

!!! warning

    A sequence diagram that shows how AEAs communicate with their environment
    throughout the execution can be found [here](../key_concepts/poc-diagram.md). However,
    it is not fully up-to-date with the implementation discussed here.

### Known limitations
The `TransactionSettlementSkill` has a known limitation that concerns the revert reason lookup.
While checking the history in `CheckTransactionHistoryRound`, an exception may get raised:

```
ValueError: The given transaction has not been reverted!
```

This error arises because of the way that we check for the revert reason; We currently
[replay](https://github.com/valory-xyz/open-autonomy/blob/25c9eacae692551eb68aad3977017ca9c5fd337b/packages/valory/contracts/gnosis_safe/contract.py#L614-L619)
the tx locally. However, there is an important limitation with this method. The replayed transaction will be
executed in isolation. This means that transactions which occurred prior to the replayed transaction within
the same block will not be accounted for! Therefore, the replay will not raise a `SolidityError` in such case,
because both the transactions happened in the same block.

The exception is handled automatically and logged as an error, so it does not affect the execution.
However, as a side effect, we may end the round with a failure status even though the transaction has settled,
because we have not managed to detect it.

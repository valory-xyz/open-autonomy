Sometimes agents and tests need to be run on specific networks. In the case of Ethereum,
you might want to use developer environments like Hardhat or Ganache as your testbed,
but at some point you will also require running on top of a public testnet like Ropsten or,
ultimately, the main chain.

To switch chains, you will first need to edit your chain configuration, as well as verify that
the relevant addresses that come into play are funded. After that, the `valory/ledger` connection's
configuration must be modified, and the process is slightly different for agents than for tests.
Last but not least, it is important to keep in mind what the average block times are in the deploying network.

## Ledger configuration for Agents
Look at you agent's `aea-config.yaml` last section. It should look like this:
```
public_id: valory/ledger:0.19.0
type: connection
config:
  ledger_apis:
    ethereum:
      address: ${LEDGER_ADDRESS:str:http://hardhat:8545}
      chain_id: ${LEDGER_CHAIN_ID:int:31337}
```
There, edit the `address` and `chain_id` fields to match your requirements. In this case, we've set
a local Hardhat node as our target chain, with its default id.

## Ledger configuration for contract integration tests
Tests that make calls to a chain usually inherit from `BaseContractTest`, located at
`/tests/test_contracts/base.py`. That class defines the `_setup_class` method that overrides
the `valory/ledger` connection's configuration:
```
new_config = {
    "address": url,
    "chain_id": DEFAULT_CHAIN_ID,
    "denom": DEFAULT_CURRENCY_DENOM,
    "default_gas_price_strategy": "eip1559",
    "gas_price_strategies": {
        "gas_station": DEFAULT_GAS_STATION_STRATEGY,
        "eip1559": DEFAULT_EIP1559_STRATEGY,
    },
}

cls.ledger_api = ledger_apis_registry.make(
    cls.identifier,
    **new_config,
)
```

As before, edit here the `address` and `chain_id` fields. That should suffice for your
test to use the desired network.

## Configuration for end to end tests
End to end agent tests inherit from the `BaseTestEnd2End` in `tests/test_agents.py`. That
class defines an `extra_configs` attribute that is used to set the agent's configuration overrides.
If your tests override that attribute, parameters defined there will be used by the agent.
This does not only apply to `valory/ledger` connection, but to any agent configuration:
```
from tests.test_agents.base import BaseTestEnd2End

class MySuperHelpfulEndToEndTestBase(BaseTestEnd2End):
    """Base class for my super helpful e2e tests."""

    extra_configs = [
        {
            "dotted_path": "vendor.valory.skills.my_super_skill_abci.models.params.args.ipfs_domain_name",
            "value": "/dns/localhost/tcp/5001/http",
        }
    ]
```

All tests that inherit from this test base class will use the new configuration.

## Configuration for validation timeout
This is going to play a significant role when performing transactions, since the validation logic is based on that.
More specifically, the corresponding `validate_timeout` specified in the `skill.yaml` files of your skills
should not be less than the average block time of the network, because timeouts  and unnecessary repricing
will happen too often. For example, at the time this document is written, the average block time
in the Ethereum mainnet is 13.3 seconds. Therefore, we should never specify a value less than that, and it
would also be reasonable to allow for more time before giving up, because it is not rare for block times to be higher
and since there is no guarantee that a transaction will make it into the next block.
The underlying mechanism will take care to backoff linearly, with `retry_timeout` as a base,
while checking if the transaction has been validated, and stop when the `validate_timeout` is reached.
An example configuration for Ethereum mainnet is provided below:

```yaml
models:
  params:
    args:
      retry_attempts: 13
      retry_timeout: 13.3
      validate_timeout: 1205
```

This creates the following condition:
```python
min(retry_timeout * ((n_retries / 2) * (n_retries + 1)), validate_timeout) = min(13.3 * n_retries, 1205)
```

where `n_retries âˆˆ [1, retry_attempts]` is the number of times we have tried so far.

So for example if we are in the fourth retry:
```python
min(13.3 * ((4 / 2) * (4 + 1)), 1205) = min(133, 1205) = 133
```

but in the last retry:
```python
min(13.3 * ((13 / 2) * (13 + 1)), 1205) = min(1210.3, 1205) = 1205
```

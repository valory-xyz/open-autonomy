The purpose of this guide is to provide a step-by-step instructions to gain familiarity with the {{open_autonomy}} framework, and use a number of CLI commands to run a [Hello World agent service](../demos/hello_world_demo.md) as a local deployment. More concretely, in this guide, you will end up running:

  - 4 Docker containers implementing the 4 agents of the service, and
  - 4 Docker containers implementing one Tendermint node for each agent.

Having completed this guide, you can take a look at the [overview of the development process](./overview_of_the_development_process.md) with the {{open_autonomy}} framework, and continue with the rest of the guides in this section.

Before starting this guide, ensure that your machine satisfies the framework requirements and that you have followed the [set up guide](./set_up.md). As a result you should have a Pipenv workspace folder.

## Step-by-step instructions

!!! note
    On **MacOS** and **Windows**, running Docker containers requires having Docker Desktop running as well. If you're using one of those operating systems, remember to start Docker Desktop
    before you run agent services.

Now that you have set up your machine to work with {{open_autonomy}}, we are in position to use the CLI to fetch the agent service from the remote registry and deploy it locally.

1. Use the CLI to fetch the [Hello World agent service](../demos/hello_world_demo.md). This will connect to the remote registry and download the files that make up the service to the `hello_world` folder:
    ```bash
    autonomy fetch valory/hello_world:0.1.0:bafybeih3ra7ii3wy5cjnrgivu5ma2pt24ynrc6yer3ew2mmv2uzx4fxudq --service
    cd hello_world
    ```

2. Build the Docker image of the service agents:
    ```bash
    autonomy build-image
    ```
    After the command finishes building the image, you can see that it has created the image by executing:
    ```bash
    docker image ls | grep hello_world
    ```

3. Prepare a JSON file `keys.json` containing the addresses and keys of the four agents that make up the agent service. Below you have some sample keys for testing:

    !!! warning "Important"
        Use these keys for testing purposes only. **Never use these keys in a production environment or for personal use.**

        ```json
        [
          {
              "address": "0x15d34AAf54267DB7D7c367839AAf71A00a2C6A65",
              "private_key": "0x47e179ec197488593b187f80a00eb0da91f1b9d0b13f8733639f19c30a34926a"
          },
          {
              "address": "0x9965507D1a55bcC2695C58ba16FB37d819B0A4dc",
              "private_key": "0x8b3a350cf5c34c9194ca85829a2df0ec3153be0318b5e2d3348e872092edffba"
          },
          {
              "address": "0x976EA74026E726554dB657fA54763abd0C3a0aa9",
              "private_key": "0x92db14e403b83dfe3df233f83dfa3a0d7096f21ca9b0d6d6b8d88b2b4ec1564e"
          },
          {
              "address": "0x14dC79964da2C08b23698B3D3cc7Ca32193d9955",
              "private_key": "0x4bbbf85ce3377467afe5d46f804f221813b2bb87f24d81f60f1fcdbf7cbf4356"
          }
        ]
        ```

4. Build the deployment setup for the service:
    ```bash
    autonomy deploy build keys.json --aev
    ```

5. Navigate to the deployment environment folder (`./abci_build`) and run the deployment locally using
    ```bash
    cd abci_build
    autonomy deploy run
    ```

    This will deploy the [Hello World agent service](../demos/hello_world_demo.md) locally with four agents connected to four Tendermint nodes.

    At this point you should see a (verbose) output of the agent logs, which should look something like this:
    ```bash
    (...)

    abci0    | [2022-01-01 00:00:00,000] [INFO] [agent] arrived block with timestamp: 2022-00-00 00:00:00.000000
    abci0    | [2022-01-01 00:00:00,000] [INFO] [agent] current AbciApp time: 2022-00-00 00:00:00.000000
    abci0    | [2022-01-01 00:00:00,000] [INFO] Created a new local deadline for the next `begin_block` request from the Tendermint node: 2022-00-00 00:00:00.000000

    abci2    | [2022-01-01 00:00:00,000] [INFO] [agent] Entered in the 'print_message' behaviour
    abci2    | Agent agent (address 0x976EA74026E726554dB657fA54763abd0C3a0aa9) in period 2 says: HELLO_WORLD!
    abci2    | [2022-01-01 00:00:00,000] [INFO] [agent] printed_message=Agent agent (address 0x976EA74026E726554dB657fA54763abd0C3a0aa9) in period 2 says: HELLO_WORLD!

    (...)
    ```

6. The logs of a single agent or [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) node can be inspected in another terminal with, e.g.,
    ```bash
    docker logs <container_id> --follow
    ```
    where `<container_id>` refers to the Docker container ID for either an agent
    (`abci0`, `abci1`, `abci2` and `abci3`) or a [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) node (`node0`, `node1`, `node2` and `node3`).

    Try to inspect the service agent logs yourself and identify when they say "HELLO_WORLD!"

The purpose of this guide is to provide step-by-step instructions to gain familiarity with the [overall development process](./overview_of_the_development_process.md) of the {{open_autonomy}} framework.

We will show how to use the CLI to run a local deployment of the [Hello World service](https://docs.autonolas.network/demos/hello-world/), which comprises:

- 4 Docker containers implementing the 4 agents of the service, and
- 4 Docker containers implementing a Tendermint node for each agent.

Before starting this guide, ensure that your machine satisfies the framework requirements and that you have followed the [set up guide](./set_up.md). As a result you should have a Pipenv workspace folder.

## Step-by-step instructions

!!! note
    On **MacOS** and **Windows**, running Docker containers requires having Docker Desktop running as well. If you're using one of those operating systems, remember to start Docker Desktop
    before you run agent services.

1. Fetch the [Hello World service](https://docs.autonolas.network/demos/hello-world/) from the remote registry. Within the workspace folder (not the remote registry) run:

    ```bash
    autonomy fetch valory/hello_world:0.1.0:bafybeicdcrhpekqbwzeam2fi7npnl6qfwejgo73ftwoy4tofwbrsl5ene4 --service
    ```

2. Build the Docker image of the service agents:

    ```bash
    cd hello_world
    autonomy build-image
    ```

    After the command finishes, check that the image has been created:

    ```bash
    docker image ls | grep hello_world
    ```

3. Prepare and build the service deployment:

    1. Prepare a `keys.json` file containing wallet address and the private key for each of the agents.

        ??? example "Example of a `keys.json` file"

            <span style="color:red">**WARNING: Use this file for testing purposes only. Never use the keys or addresses provided in this example in a production environment or for personal use.**</span>

            ```json title="keys.json"
            [
            {
                "address": "0x15d34AAf54267DB7D7c367839AAf71A00a2C6A65",
                "private_key": "0x47e179ec197488593b187f80a00eb0da91f1b9d0b13f8733639f19c30a34926a"
            },
            {
                "address": "0x9965507D1a55bcC2695C58ba16FB37d819B0A4dc",
                "private_key": "0x8b3a350cf5c34c9194ca85829a2df0ec3153be0318b5e2d3348e872092edffba"
            },
            {
                "address": "0x976EA74026E726554dB657fA54763abd0C3a0aa9",
                "private_key": "0x92db14e403b83dfe3df233f83dfa3a0d7096f21ca9b0d6d6b8d88b2b4ec1564e"
            },
            {
                "address": "0x14dC79964da2C08b23698B3D3cc7Ca32193d9955",
                "private_key": "0x4bbbf85ce3377467afe5d46f804f221813b2bb87f24d81f60f1fcdbf7cbf4356"
            }
            ]
            ```

    2. Export the environment variable `ALL_PARTICIPANTS` with all the agents' addresses:
        ```bash
        export ALL_PARTICIPANTS='[
            "0x15d34AAf54267DB7D7c367839AAf71A00a2C6A65",
            "0x9965507D1a55bcC2695C58ba16FB37d819B0A4dc",
            "0x976EA74026E726554dB657fA54763abd0C3a0aa9",
            "0x14dC79964da2C08b23698B3D3cc7Ca32193d9955"
        ]'
        ```

    3. (Optional) Export environment variables to customize the service configuration.

        ??? example "Example of exported environment variables"

            ```bash
            export HELLO_WORLD_STRING_0="Your HELLO WORLD message for Agent 0"
            export HELLO_WORLD_STRING_1="Your HELLO WORLD message for Agent 1"
            export HELLO_WORLD_STRING_2="Your HELLO WORLD message for Agent 2"
            export HELLO_WORLD_STRING_3="Your HELLO WORLD message for Agent 3"
            ```

    4. Build the service deployment:

        ```bash
        autonomy deploy build keys.json -ltm
        ```

4. Run the service:

    ```bash
    cd abci_build
    autonomy deploy run
    ```

    This will deploy the [Hello World service](https://docs.autonolas.network/demos/hello-world/) locally with four agents connected to four Tendermint nodes.

    You can cancel the local execution at any time by pressing ++ctrl+c++.

At this point you should see a (verbose) output of the agent logs, which should look something like this:

```bash
(...)

abci0    | [2022-01-01 00:00:00,000] [INFO] [agent] arrived block with timestamp: 2022-00-00 00:00:00.000000

(...)
```

The logs of a single agent or [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) node can be inspected in another terminal with, e.g.,

```bash
docker logs <container_id> --follow
```

where `<container_id>` refers to the Docker container ID for an agent
(`abci0`, `abci1`, `abci2` and `abci3`) or a [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) node (`node0`, `node1`, `node2` and `node3`).

Try to inspect the service agent logs yourself and identify when they say the default "HELLO_WORLD!" message or your custom message.

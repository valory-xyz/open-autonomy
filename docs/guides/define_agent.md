The next step consists in defining the AI agent. All agent instances in the AI agent share the same code base (blueprint).
However, each operator can configure their agent instance. For example, in an oracle AI agent,
each operator can define a different data provider.

## What you will learn

This guide covers step 3 of the [development process](./overview_of_the_development_process.md). You will learn how to define the AI agent, how to add the {{fsm_app}}, and how to add other existing components required by your agent blueprint.

You must ensure that your machine satisfies the [framework requirements](./set_up.md#requirements), you have [set up the framework](./set_up.md#set-up-the-framework), and you have a local registry [populated with some default components](./overview_of_the_development_process.md#populate-the-local-registry-for-the-guides). As a result you should have a Pipenv workspace folder with an initialized local registry (`./packages`) in it.

## Step-by-step instructions

In order to deploy and run an AI agent you need an agent blueprint with a working {{fsm_app}}. We base this guide on a default {{fsm_app}} available in the remote registry, namely, the `hello_world_abci` {{fsm_app}}. As a result, we will define an agent blueprint implementing a functionality equivalent to the [Hello World AI agent](https://stack.olas.network/demos/hello-world/). You can, of course, use your own {{fsm_app}} to define your agent blueprint.

!!! warning "Important"

    If you have just [scaffolded an {{fsm_app}} in the previous step](./code_fsm_app_skill.md) but you didn't complete coding the business logic, then an agent blueprint that uses that {{fsm_app}} will fail to run. For this reason, we recommend that you use the `hello_world_abci` {{fsm_app}} in a first read of this guide.

1. **Ensure that the components required by your agent blueprint are in the local registry.** All the required components by your agent blueprint and their dependencies must be downloaded to the local registry. You can read [how to add missing components to the local registry](#).
If you have [populated the local registry](./overview_of_the_development_process.md#populate-the-local-registry-for-the-guides) with the required components to follow these guides, you do not need to take any further action.

2. **Create the agent blueprint configuration file.** Create a folder for your agent blueprint in the local registry (`./packages`). Pay attention to the correct format of the folder:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ./packages/your_name/agents/your_agent_blueprint/
    ```

    Within the agent folder, create the agent blueprint configuration file `aea-config.yaml`:

    ```bash
    touch ./packages/your_name/agents/your_agent_blueprint/aea-config.yaml
    ```

    This file must contain:

      * A number of mandatory parameters.

        !!! warning "Important"

            Ensure that `author` and `agent_name` match the path within the local registry.

      * A reference to the {{fsm_app}} skill.
      * References to other components required by the agent blueprint (or dependencies of the {{fsm_app}} skill), under the relevant sections.

        !!! warning "Important"

            There are a number of components which are mandatory for agent blueprints that are part of an AI agent:

            * Connections: `valory/abci`.
            * Protocols: `open_aea/signing`, `valory/abci`, `valory/acn`(*).
            * Skills: `valory/abstract_abci`, `valory/abstract_round_abci`, `valory/termination_abci`(*).

            (*) Components required only if the AI agent is minted in the {{ autonolas_protocol }}.

      * Configuration overrides that specify values for component parameters. These overrides are separated by YAML document separators `---` and will be discussed in a further section.

    ???+ example "Example of an `aea-config.yaml` file"

        This is a complete example of an agent blueprint configuration file that uses the `hello_world_abci` {{fsm_app}} and overrides some required component parameters. 

        You will notice that there are a lot of parameters to be configured for the required components. For an initial read of this guide, you can ignore these parameters, but it is important that you identify how the references to the particular component parameter being overridden.

          save_path: .certs/acn_cosmos_9006.txt
        is_abstract: true
        ```

    You should also create a `README.md` file with the description of your agent blueprint in plain text or Markdown format:

    ```bash
    echo "Your agent blueprint description." > ./packages/your_name/agents/your_agent_blueprint/README.md
    ```

3. **Create an entry for your agent blueprint in the local registry.** Add the corresponding entry to the local registry index file (`./packages/packages.json`). You must add the entry to the `dev` section, because it is a component being developed by you. You can use a placeholder for its hash value, as it will be corrected afterwards:

    <!-- Use js instead of json lexer to support mkdocs-material comment features -->
    ```js
    {
      "dev": {
        "agent/your_name/your_agent_blueprint/0.1.0": "bafybei0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        /* (1)! */
      },
      "third_party": {
        /* (2)! */
      }
    }
    ```

    1. Any other `dev` entries that you have go here. Entries must be comma-separated (`,`).
    2. Any other `third_party` entries that you have go here. Entries must be comma-separated (`,`).

    Update the package hashes. The command below will correct any hash mismatch in the `aea-config.yaml` file, as well as in the local registry index file (`./packages/packages.json`):

    ```bash
    autonomy packages lock
    ```

4. **(Optional) Run and test the agent instance locally.** We will show you how to run an AI agent deployment with multiple agent instances in the next guide. However, you can also run a standalone version (that is, without being part of an AI agent) of the agent blueprint you have created. This can be useful to test and debug certain features quickly. Below we will be using the `valory/hello_world` agent blueprint, but you can replace it by `your_name/your_agent_blueprint` accordingly.

      1. In the workspace folder, fetch the agent blueprint from the local registry:

         ```bash
         autonomy fetch valory/hello_world:0.1.0 --local
         ```

      2. Provision your agent instance with an Ethereum private key:

         ```bash
         cd hello_world
         echo -n "0x47e179ec197488593b187f80a00eb0da91f1b9d0b13f8733639f19c30a34926a" > your_agent_key.txt
         autonomy add-key ethereum your_agent_key.txt
         ```

         If your agent blueprint is using an {{fsm_app}}, you also need to override the variable `all_participants` in the `aea-config.yaml` file with the wallet address of this private key as follows:

         ```yaml title="aea-config.yaml"
         # (...)
         all_participants: ${list:["0x15d34AAf54267DB7D7c367839AAf71A00a2C6A65"]}
         ```

         <span style="color:red">**WARNING: Use this key for testing purposes only. Never use keys or addresses provided in this example in a production environment or for personal use.**</span>

      3. Run your agent instance:

         ```bash
         autonomy -s run #(1)!
         ```

         1. The `-s` flag will skip consistency checks of agent blueprint during command execution. This is required because the `aea-config.yaml` file was modified.

         At this point, you may notice that your agent blueprint requires specific Python packages to be installed. For the `valory/hello_world` agent blueprint, you can do so by executing:

         ```bash
         pip install hypothesis grpcio typing-extensions py-ecc asn1crypto
         ```

         You can retry running your agent instance afterwards.

      4. On a separate terminal, open a Tendermint node:

         ```bash
         rm -rf ~/.tendermint #(1)!
         tendermint init
         tendermint node --proxy_app=tcp://127.0.0.1:26658 --rpc.laddr=tcp://127.0.0.1:26657 --p2p.laddr=tcp://0.0.0.0:26656 --p2p.seeds= --consensus.create_empty_blocks=true
         ```

         1. This will prevent errors caused by dirty files from earlier executions of Tendermint. Ensure that you don't want to keep these files.

    At this point, you should see how your agent instance runs and exchanges messages with the Tendermint node. Note that, while running an isolated agent instance might be useful to quickly test and debug certain functionalities, you need to build and test a whole AI agent deployment to ensure that it works as intended.

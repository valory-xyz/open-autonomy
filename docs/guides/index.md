#Guides - index

In this section you will find a number of useful guides which will help you
to understand [the overall development process](./overview_of_the_development_process.md)
of an agent service with the {{open_autonomy}} framework, including:

- creating the agent service business logic,
- creating the agents that make up the service,
- publishing the service in a remote repository, and
- registering the service in the on-chain protocol.

If you are new to the framework, we suggest that you start with the [quick start](./quick_start.md)
guide, and proceed with the remaining ones in the order presented.

# ABCI Application Price Oracle with AEAs

This demo consists of a network of AEAs, implemented as {{abci_app}}s reaching
Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus, that work as an Oracle to jointly agree on a price estimate
of the current Bitcoin price in US dollars. The underlying
consensus mechanism for the {{abci_app}} is powered by Tendermint.

## Requirements

In addition to the general requirements presented for setting up the {{valory_stack}}, make sure that you have installed on your machine:

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)

## Running the Local Demo

To set up the network:

```
make localnet-start
```

This will spawn:

- A network of 4 Tendermint nodes, each one trying to connect to
  a separate ABCI application instance;
- 4 AEAs, each one running an instance of the ABCI application,
  and a finite-state machine behaviour to interact with
  the round phases.

The following is the output of a single AEA (you can use `docker logs {container_id} --follow`):
```

```

From the logs, you can see the different behaviours of the
finite-state machine behaviour: `registration`, `observation`,
and `estimate` states. Moreover,
you can see that the observation of this agent
has been considered in the set of observation shared
among all the AEAs (`Using observations: ...`).
Finally, the consensus is reached among all the AEAs
on the BTC/USD estimate `44172.06142864574`,
which is a simple average of the set of observations.

An analogous output is produced by other AEAs.
Here it is reported the output of another AEA
that participated in the same round:
